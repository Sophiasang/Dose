#Final Project

##Dose

###Keepin' your pills simple since 2016 

This program was designed by Sophia Sangervasi, Sarah Gillogly, and Caitlin Kantor. We created this webiste with the
vision of helping people organize their daily medications. Users simply enter the name of their prescription, the side
effects of the medication, and when to take them. When the alarm goes off an alert pops up reminding you to take your medication. Additionally we included a list of commonly taken medications and their side affects. This is our prototype modeling what the final version would look like.

Our program was designed with hard work and inspiration to help make people's lives just a little bit easier.
